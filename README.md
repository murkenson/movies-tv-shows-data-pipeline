# This is the final project for [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [DataTalks Club](https://datatalks.club)  üöÄüò§


## Introduction


### Movies and TV shows on streaming platforms üé•üçø

![Movies and TV shows](/recreate_project/static/project_logo_040.svg)

I really enjoy watching movies and TV shows, and I recently watched `Dune 2` and `Gentlemen` on Netflix. It was fantastic! 

For my final project as part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024 program, I have selected two datasets from Kaggle: 

- The Full TMDb TV Shows Dataset for 2024 (CSV files `78,3 MB` 214452 rows, 19 columns)
- The full TMDb Movies Dataset for 2024 (CSV files `463,1 MB` 214452 rows, 19 columns)

I will be focusing my analysis on these platforms: 

- Netflix
- Amazon Prime
- Disney+
- Hulu


### Problem description

- Understanding the content is available in different countries
- Identifying similar content through matching text-based features
- Network analysis of Actors / Directors and finding interesting insights
- Does Hulu have a greater focus on TV shows than movies in recent years?

## Data Source

Dataset was taken from Kaggle:

 - [The Full TMDb TV Shows Dataset for 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/full-tmdb-tv-shows-dataset-2023-150k-shows)
 - [The Full TMDb TV Movies Dataset for 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies)


## Reproduce the project

>How to Recreate the Project? 

Recreating the project is a simple process and should only take about 15 minutes. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this [here](/recreate_project/how_to.md).

## Future Improvements

- Create tests for all code and sql
- Move other commands to Make-file to make a reproducibility in less commands
- Implement CI/CD
- Add API for extracting data from web 

## Credits

A special thank you to the **instructors**, who have provided guidance and support throughout the course. Their expertise and insights have been incredibly valuable in the development of the Movies and TV Shows project. The course has taught me a great deal of useful skills and techniques, which have greatly enhanced my knowledge as a data engineer.
