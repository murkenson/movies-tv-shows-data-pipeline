## Introduction

### Overview

**Movies and TV shows on streaming platforms üé•üçø**

![Movies and TV shows](/recreate_project/static/040_project_logo.svg)

I really enjoy watching movies and TV shows, and I recently watched `Dune 2` and `Gentlemen` on Netflix. It was fantastic! 

For my final project as part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024 program, I have selected two the TMDB (The Movie Database) datasets from Kaggle: 

- The Full TMDb TV Shows Dataset for 2024 
- The full TMDb Movies Dataset for 2024

These datasets provide comprehensive information about various movies and TV shows, including ratings, genres, cast, and more.

I will be focusing my analysis on these platforms: 

- Netflix
- Amazon Prime
- Disney+
- Hulu


### Problem description


1. **Platform Content Overview**: Analysis of TV shows and movies available on each platform.
2. **Decadal Distribution of Releases**: Examination of the distribution of TV shows and movies by their release years over the last ten years, categorized by platform.
3. **Genre Dominance by Platform**: Identification of the top five prevalent genres on each platform.
4. **Episodic Excellence**: Ranking the top 10 TV shows on each platform based on the number of episodes.
5. **Film Length Leaders**: Ranking the top 10 movies on each platform by their runtime duration.

## Reproducability

>How to Recreate the Project? 

Recreating the project is a simple process and should only take about 15 minutes. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this [here](/recreate_project/how_to.md).

## Future Improvements

- Create tests for all code and sql
- Move other commands to Make-file to make a reproducibility in less commands
- Implement CI/CD
- Add API for extracting data from web
