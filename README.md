# This is the final project for [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [DataTalks Club](https://datatalks.club)  üöÄüò§


## Introduction


### Movies and TV shows on streaming platforms üé•üçø

![Movies and TV shows](/recreate_project/static/040_project_logo.svg)

I really enjoy watching movies and TV shows, and I recently watched `Dune 2` and `Gentlemen` on Netflix. It was fantastic! 

For my final project as part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024 program, I have selected two the TMDB (The Movie Database) datasets from Kaggle: 

- The Full TMDb TV Shows Dataset for 2024 
- The full TMDb Movies Dataset for 2024

These datasets provide comprehensive information about various movies and TV shows, including ratings, genres, cast, and more.

I will be focusing my analysis on these platforms: 

- Netflix
- Amazon Prime
- Disney+
- Hulu


### Problem description

- Understanding the content is available in different countries
- Identifying similar content through matching text-based features

## Reproduce the project

>How to Recreate the Project? 

Recreating the project is a simple process and should only take about 15 minutes. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this [here](/recreate_project/how_to.md).

## Future Improvements

- Create tests for all code and sql
- Move other commands to Make-file to make a reproducibility in less commands
- Implement CI/CD
- Add API for extracting data from web 

## Credits

A special thank you to the **instructors**, who have provided guidance and support throughout the course.
